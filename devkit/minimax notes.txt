Variations on minimax: 
expectimax: add a third possibility: randomness. take the weighted average of the possibilities weighed by their liklihoods of happening

Expectimax is very dependent on the heuristic function


Key concepts of Markov decision processes
	To handle infinite games: either decay rewards or set a depth limit. 
V*(s) = max for all a (sum for s' (T(s,a,s') * [R(s,a,s')+gamma*V*(s')]))

value at current state = maximum of (sum of [reward at new outcome + decay * value at new outcome] over all possible outcomes)
